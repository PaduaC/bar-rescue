# bar-rescue
Inspired by two of my favorite TV shows: Bar Rescue and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. My idea for this project came from an episode of Bar Rescue where two owners get into a dispute about equity after one owner steps down from his position. I decided to use Paddy's Irish Pub from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia as my example.
